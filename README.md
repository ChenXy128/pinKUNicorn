## Technical Design for TikTok Shop Recommendation Application

### **Project Overview:**

The project aims to develop a recommendation system for a TikTok store that provides tailored product suggestions to users based on their preferences and needs. The key functionalities include integrating a product fetching system from a fake store API, utilizing ChatGPT for generating personalized recommendations, and presenting these recommendations through a user-friendly interface.

### **A Newly Developed Recommendation Page:**

To integrate user circumstances into personalized results for the "For You" feed, we will leverage the collected user data and the AI-powered recommendation model. Here’s how we will approach this integration:

### Data Collection
We have implemented text-based components on a new page to collect user data. This data includes user preferences, behavior, and interaction history. The data collection process is streamlined and user-friendly, ensuring high user engagement and accurate data acquisition.

### AI-Powered Recommendations
The collected data is sent to the ChatGPT service, which generates product recommendations based on user input. This recommendation engine is designed to understand user preferences and predict products that align with their interests.

### Integration with TikTok Shop API
Currently, our application uses the `Fakestore API`, but we will replace it with the `TikTok Shop API`. The integration involves parsing ChatGPT’s responses to extract product details, which are then used to fetch real-time product information from the TikTok Shop API. This ensures that the recommendations are relevant and up-to-date with the latest offerings on TikTok Shop.

### Frontend and Backend Architecture
Our application uses `React Native` for the frontend and `Node.js` for the backend. The `React Native` components handle user interactions and display the recommended products in an organized manner. The backend, powered by `Node.js`, manages the data flow between the user interface, ChatGPT service, and `TikTok Shop API`.

### Personalized 'For You' Feed
Based on the collected user data and AI-generated recommendations, the "For You" feed is personalized as follows:
1. **User Input Analysis:** The data collected from the new text-based components is analyzed to understand user preferences.
2. **Recommendation Generation:** ChatGPT generates product recommendations tailored to the user’s input.
3. **API Integration:** These recommendations are parsed and used to query the `TikTok Shop API` for detailed product information.
4. **Feed Customization:** The `React Native` frontend displays these recommended products in a personalized feed, ensuring that each user sees products that are highly relevant to their interests and circumstances.

### Example Workflow
1. **User Interaction:** The user answers questions on the new data collection page.
2. **Data Processing:** The input is sent to ChatGPT, which processes the data and generates product recommendations.
3. **API Query:** The backend parses ChatGPT’s response and queries the `TikTok Shop API` for product details.
4. **Feed Display:** The frontend displays the recommended products in a structured and user-friendly format on the "For You" feed.

By following this approach, we ensure that user circumstances are effectively integrated into personalized results, enhancing the overall user experience on the TikTok Shop app.
